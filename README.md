# RTK

RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) is a project aimed at implementing precise positioning using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data. This system uses differential GNSS techniques to enhance the accuracy of position data.

## Features

- Processes GNSS data for real-time kinematic positioning
- Implements algorithms for differential GNSS
- Supports integration with GNSS hardware

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- GNSS hardware and data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akui1321/RTK.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RTK

## Usage
1. Connect your GNSS hardware.
2. Run the executable.

The program will start processing GNSS data for real-time kinematic positioning.

## Project Structure
- GNSS_PROGRAM/: Contains the source code for GNSS processing.
- GNSS_PROGRAM.sln: Solution file for building the project.
